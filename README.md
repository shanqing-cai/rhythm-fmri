Author: Shanqing Cai (shanqing.cai@gmail.com)


NOTE: This code by itself cannot run properly. It requires 

1) the Mex program Audapter to process audio input and output. Write to the author to request Audapter if needed. 

2) Some scripts in S.Cai's commonmcode repository. 

3) The Julius / Julian ASR engine (Windows version), in conjunction with the American English acoustic models supplied by VoxForge: julius-3.5.2-quickstart-windows. Freely available from 
http://www.voxforge.org/home/download

4) Some ASR-related code in the asr and asrcode directories require the CMU American English pronunciation dictionary:
