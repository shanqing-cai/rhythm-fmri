Rhythm-fMRI project

=== 2009/12/01 ===
NEW_DIR: rhythm-fmri spawned from sap-fmri.

DOING: writing the code for extracting duration and intensity from a Harvard sentence recording. 
	There are plenty of recordings of this sort to test on from APSTV, APSTV2 and APSTV_NW experiments. 
	MATLAB_CODE: rhythm-fmri/mcode/analyzeSentence.m
	Usage example: 
		analyzeSentence('G:\DATA\APSTV\AS_PS23\main\rep9\trial-7-6.mat','plot')

DOING: Add tone-sequence generating function to ADAPT_VC_RATIO_RHYTHM
MATLAB_CODE: rhythm-fmri/mcode/testToneSeqGen.m
	Basically done. 

DOING: MATLAB_CODE: genRandIntervals. 
	All 8-interval sequences right now. 

MATLAB_CODE: getRandSentences.m
